/**
 * Comb Sort — improves on bubble sort by comparing elements separated by a
 * gap that shrinks each pass (starting at the array length, dividing by
 * ~1.3, flooring to a minimum of 1) instead of only ever-adjacent elements.
 * This clears small values stuck near the tail ("turtles") far faster than
 * plain bubble sort. Once the gap reaches 1 it behaves like bubble sort and
 * stops as soon as a full pass makes no swaps.
 *
 * The shrinking gap means no index can be considered in its final position
 * until the terminal snapshot.
 *
 * @yields snapshot objects (see _utils.ts)
