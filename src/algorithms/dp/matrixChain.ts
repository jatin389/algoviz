/**
 * Matrix Chain Multiplication — `dp[i][j]` = the fewest scalar multiplications
 * needed to compute the product `A_i ... A_j`.
 *
 * This one is in the set specifically because it does *not* fill row by row.
 * A cell depends on shorter sub-chains, which lie along the diagonals below and
 * to the left of it, so the fill order is by chain length: the main diagonal
 * first, then the one above it, and so on to the single cell in the top-right
 * corner. Flattening it to a row-major sweep would read cells that have not
 * been computed yet, and the animation would show a table filling in an order
 * that could not possibly be correct — which is exactly the misconception
 * ("DP means nested for-loops top to bottom") this algorithm exists to break.
 *
 * It is also the only algorithm here whose traceback is a *tree* rather than a
 * path: the optimal split at (i, j) creates two independent sub-problems, both
 * of which must be decoded to write the parenthesisation. The path therefore
 * grows by a pre-order descent rather than by walking backwards.
 *
 * Pseudocode lines this generator tags (see `pseudocode.ts`):
 *   0  dp[i][i] = 0
 *   2  dp[i][j] = min over k of dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + d[i]*d[k+1]*d[j+1]
 *   4  traceback
 *   5  done

/**
 * One branch per split point k. Each reads TWO cells — the left sub-chain and
 * the right one — which is why `DpBranch.deps` is a list rather than a single
 * dep. `deps[0]` (the left half, `dp[i][k]`) is the branch's representative and
 * becomes `DpStep.chosen`; the right half is still drawn as a dependency arrow
 * but not as the emphasised one. That is an acknowledged compromise of the
 * single-cell `DpStep.chosen` field, and the `explain` text names k explicitly
 * so the split is unambiguous even where the arrows under-state it.
 *
 * Branch text is deliberately terse (`k=2:8000`): a 30-matrix chain gives the
 * corner cell 29 branches, and spelling each one out as
 * `dp[0][2]=4500+dp[3][7]=1200+40*20*10` would produce a 900-character explain
 * string that no inspector panel can usefully render.
