/**
 * Prim's algorithm — grow one tree outward from a root, repeatedly taking the
 * cheapest edge that crosses from the tree to a node outside it.
 *
 * WHAT `MstStep.forest` MEANS HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LIE. `MstStep` carries
 * a `DsuSnapshot` because Kruskal is *driven* by a disjoint set. Prim is not:
 * it decides with an in-tree flag and a candidate list, and it would be
 * perfectly correct with no disjoint set anywhere. So the field could have
 * been made optional, or filled with a fake.
 *
 * It is neither. This generator keeps a real `DisjointSet` and calls a real
 * `link` on it every single time it accepts an edge — the same structure, the
 * same operation, maintained honestly. That is well-defined because Prim only
 * ever accepts an edge whose far endpoint is outside the tree, so every one of
 * those unions genuinely merges two different sets. The resulting forest is
 * therefore exactly true: the grown tree is one set, every not-yet-reached
 * node is still a singleton, and `components` counts down to 1 precisely when
 * (and only when) the graph turns out to be connected — the same meaning the
 * number has under Kruskal.
 *
 * The honest caveat, and the reason this comment exists: the counters describe
 * work Prim *does*, not work Prim *needs*. `unions` is the accepted-edge count
 * and is real. `finds` and `compressions` are non-zero only because `link` is
 * reached through the set's own `find`, which Prim would not otherwise perform
 * — they measure the bookkeeping, not a decision. That is why Kruskal's find
 * count is the interesting one and Prim's is not, and the stats panel should
 * be read with that in mind. Filling the field with zeros or with a fabricated
 * "one big set" array would have been the lie; running the structure for real
 * and being clear about which numbers carry meaning is not.
 *
 * The frontier is kept as a plain candidate array with a linear scan for the
 * minimum, rather than a binary heap. A heap would take this from O(V·E) to
 * O(E log V), and it is the wrong trade here twice over: the candidate list is
 * exactly what the edge panel draws, so it wants to be an inspectable list of
 * crossing edges rather than an array-encoded heap whose order means nothing
 * on screen; and the node counts this view generates (single digits to low
 * tens) make the difference unmeasurable. Swap in a heap the day this runs on
 * a graph large enough to notice — not before.
 *
 * "Lazy" deletion, also on purpose: an edge whose far endpoint joins the tree
 * by some other route is not removed eagerly, it is left in the list and
 * *rejected* when it comes up. That gives rejection the same visible meaning
 * it has in Kruskal — "this edge would close a cycle" — instead of having
 * edges silently vanish.
 *
 * DISCONNECTED GRAPHS. When the candidate list empties with nodes still
 * unreached, the tree cannot grow any further, so the run restarts from the
 * lowest-numbered unreached node and keeps going. The result is a spanning
 * forest, `components` settles above 1, and the terminal snapshot says so —
 * identical handling and identical wording to Kruskal, which is what makes
 * "Kruskal's total weight equals Prim's" hold on disconnected inputs too.
 *
 * Time: O(V · E) as written. Space: O(V + E).
